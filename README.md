This project was developed collaboratively using GitHub's collaboration features.

## Sanan – Created the base HTML structure and worked on overall design

At the beginning of the project, I created the main HTML structure. I built the foundational skeleton and layout of the website so that my teammates could easily develop their own features on top of a clean and organized base. I also established a consistent design language to ensure that all pages look well-organized and professional.

Tasks I completed:

1. Created the main HTML skeleton for the index.html homepage

2. Built the structure for the navigation bar, header, and footer

3. Defined the core styling principles to maintain design consistency across all pages

4. Designed the initial layout in the CSS file so that other team members could continue development smoothly

## Omar – Developed the signin and signup pages and added form functionality

## Irana  – Built the location and contact subpages; made improvements to the main page

I was responsible for creating the location and contact subpages. I designed and implemented these pages to enhance user experience by providing essential information about item locations and a way to reach out to the team. Additionally, I made several improvements to the main page to ensure better usability and visual appeal.

Tasks I completed:

1. Developed the location.html page, displaying item locations or regional info

2. Built the contact.html page with a contact form and team details

3. Improved the main index.html page layout and design
